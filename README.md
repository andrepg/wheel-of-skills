# Wheel of Skills

This is a project implementing a single form, based on questions and generate a chart using ChartJS.

Some private work to build a landing page and also a good project to help someone starting or needing a boilerplate. All project it's in english and tried to comment the most hard parts of the code. 

It's a almost finished project for the client, but can be optimized or improved at anytime.

## Project Setup

First, to setup this project you must use Yarn and run the `install` script from inside the project root.

> Yeah, I know there's NPM but I like Yarn a little bit more.

```sh
> yarn install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

When running in development mode you can run the `dev` command, that will automatically run a server with Hot Reloead enabled. You can change any Vue based file that will be recognized by server and changed on your website.

```sh
yarn run dev
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

You can run a Lint report on your developed code by using the `lint` command. Another choice it's open project on VS Code. 

```sh
yarn run lint
```

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
